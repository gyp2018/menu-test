    "content": "With your Jetsurf you would have received a battery charger. This is very important, this battery charger has been partially designed for the Jetsurf. You cannot use any other charger to recharge your battery. Before recharging your battery there are a few things you need to know. There is to types of settings to recharge your battery, the first is for the car charger, which can be plugged into any car cigarette lighter unit and the second one is for the home socket. 1st I am going to explain you the settings that you will need to put your battery charger to. The 1st thing you will need to is battery type. So I am going to push the battery type button until I get to LIFE. Then I will press ENTER. Next I will need to how many amps I want to be charging at. For a power point as in your typical house you are going to want to have it at 4A. So I am going to press the incline button and then I am going to how many cells my battery is. This is a 3-Cell battery, so you will always the cells to 3-Cells. If I am going to be charging from my car power point, I will most likely put it at a 2A charge. I will go to 4A and I will press the decline button until it goes down to 2A. Right now I am going to show you how to connect you battery charger to your Jetsurf. Right now I am charging from the wall charger at home. So I have selected a 4A battery charge. So I am going to to disconnect my battery seal from my battery, then I press the button down and I pull the battery seal apart. It is very important to make sure you put this back together once you have finished charging. So now I am going to connect my charger into my battery. Now to start charging I will hold the ENTER button down for around 2 seconds. \n It should come up with a message “Battery Check….. Now my battery has started charging. Generally a battery will take around 45min to charge fully from flat. My charger will automatically start beeping as soon as my battery is fully charged. A fully charged battery should show between 10.7 and 10.8 volts.",

    "title": "Fuel to Oil Mixture",
    "content": "A 2-stroke engine powers the Jetsurf. Meaning that you will always have to mix oil with your petrol. This is vital for the Jetsurf otherwise you will damage your engine. We recommend that you use a 2-stroke racing grade oil. The mixture that you should use is 50 to 1. Meaning 10L of petrol to every 0,2L of oil. Once you have pre-mixed your petrol and oil, you fill up your tank. \n After having filled up your tank, you insure that you have screwed the cap down properly. Check that there is no petrol in your overflow tank. The small tank is just for overflowed petrol. So once you have finished riding, poor it back into your main petrol tank.",

    "title": "Fins",
    "content": "Once you have taken your Jetsurf out of the bag you will see that there are 3 slots for the 3 fins. 2 side fins and 1 center fin. First I am going to put on my center fin. Which goes over the top of the jet. You will see there are 8 Allen key bolts. Make sure you screw your rear fin nice and firm. Once you have mounted your middle fin, the next thing you need to do is put on the 2 side fins. \n So the first thing is to place the 2 side fins nice and firm inside the holes. Thereafter you want to put the 2 screws that mount from the top of the board. This ensures that both side fins are in nice and secure.",

    "title": "Before riding",
    "content": "Now that our fuel tank is full our battery is charged our fins are attached, we are almost ready to start riding. It’s always good to get into the habit of putting Berner Super 6 Plus (WD 40 in the USA) on your board before and after riding to avoid corrosion. First you want to insure that your battery is closed. Your valve from your crankshaft is also closed and then you want to give it a nice spray all over the engine bay particularly concentrating on your front bearings, your starter engine, your crankshaft and also your rear bearing. Thereafter give your whole engine bay a general spray. Just before we start riding we want to check and make sure that our engine is running correctly and that everything is fine to go out into the water. So the first thing I am going to do is turn on my ignition on. To turn on the ignition on, you need to put the starter key into the handle. For between 3 and 30sec. Now that the ignition is on, you will see a red light blinking on the ignition and it will stay on for 4min if you don’t reinsert the key in. To turn my engine on, I need to put the key in the control handle and it will automatically start after 5 seconds. It is important to only keep your engine on outside of the water for no more that 10 – 15sec, because the engine is water-cooled and it may overheat. So now I will turn my engine on for 10 to 15 sec to warm it up and give it a quick rev to make sure my board is accelerating correctly its not stalling when I hit my accelerator and I want to make sure that my carburetor is in tune. \n If you are having difficulties, the chances are, that your carburetor is out of tune and you need to retune it. So now you can start the board by putting the magnet in and after waiting 5sec it will start. Now the last thing is to close the hood. I will ensure that all 4 laches are down nice and secure. Now I am ready to hit the water.",

    "title": "Water in the Engine",
    "content": "Next we are going to show you the incorrect way to get on to the board. Notice how the board is completely under the water. The board is taking on water and water will be in the engine compartment. Next we are going to show you how to correct this problem. Once you have recovered the board the first step is to get the water out of the board. You can do this by tipping the board upright in both directions. Next we put the board upright in the other direction to make sure that all water is completely out of the hull. Once all the water has been taken out of the hull and you try to start, you will notice that your engine sounds a little like this. Never try to start more that once. Once you hear this noise you will realize that there is water inside your engine. Right now we are going to show how to correct this problem. We have realized that there is water inside our engine. So what we need to do is wait 3min till the red ignition light stops blinking. This is very important because if you do not do this you may upset time settings. Once my battery ignition light has come off. I need to remove the spark plug. Now we are going to open the valve towards the crankshaft. Now we are turning the engine over to remove water from the crankshaft. Now the battery light has turned off. We need to remove the spark plug. First push the spark plug cap off and then remove the spark plug. Next we will get the board in a sideway position, to ensure that the water drains out of the engine. Next we are going remove the gas line. We are going to place it into the carburettor and press down on the fuel tank or on newer model the manual pump button. What this is doing is flushing petrol through the engine to get rid of all the salt water. Once you have done this put the gas line back onto the carburettor and put your magnet on the magnet switch. You see that petrol is running through the engine and cleaning it out. It is important to never put your magnet into the handle if your spark plug is removed this might put your timing settings out. \n Next you need to put your spark plug back into your engine. Make sure that it is back in nice and firm. Place the spark plug cap over the spark plug again. Make sure that this is in the correct position. Close your crankshaft valve. Now it is ok to try and re start your board. Once the board is starting and you have cleaned out your engine, it is always good to get into the habit of putting your board up into the vertical position and starting it one more time. If the engine has not started after 3 attempts, you might need to repeat the process again, because water may still be inside your engine.",

    "title": "After Riding",
    "content": "After riding your board in salt water, it is always important to make sure that you wash your board down correctly. Right now I am going to show you how to do that. First thing you need to do is getting a hose with some fresh water. Make sure you get all the salt off the board and out of the engine bay, also a little bit into a jet. So I am just going to hose it down, also a little bit into the jet. Once I have done this I want to open up my engine compartment. Next I am going to clean my engine bay, I am going to get everything wet accept into the carburetor hole. But I want to get the rest of the board wet to make sure all the salt water is gone. All the electronics in this board are waterproof. Just ensure that your battery connection is sealed. Once I have done this I am going to tip the board upright and drain all the water out of the engine bay. Once you have drained all the water out of the engine compartment, it is important to start the board once again in the vertical position. To make sure all water is out of the exhaust and out of the engine. The next thing you need to do is give the engine a spray with Berner Super 6 Plus (WD 40 in the USA). The areas you want to focus on are the bearings and the screws, starter engine, front bearing, crankshaft and back bearing. \n After this, give the hole engine bay a general spray down with Berner Super 6 Plus (WD 40 in the USA). If the board is going to be left more than 7days without riding, its important to put some Berner Super 6 Plus (WD 40 in the USA) into the engine. First you need to start the board and while the board is running you need to spray some Berner Super 6 Plus (WD 40 in the USA) over the carburetor. This insures that there is Berner Super 6 Plus (WD 40 in the USA) inside the engine. If you do not clean and maintain your board correctly you will void your warranty.",

Now you put the key in and wait 5 seconds until the board will start. Start accelerating ensuring that the nose dose not go under the water. Next we are going to show how to do a deep-water start. \n First, swim up next to the board insuring that you do not lye on the board. Grab the handle and put the key into the handle, you should be swimming next to the board and not on the board. Do not get up onto the board until the board is actually moving.",

    "content": "Put the key into the handle and the board will start after 5 seconds. You will now knee first, then put the front foot in the front foot strap. Once feel comfortable you will put the rear foot into the rear strap. Now you can balance with the handle and stand up. After riding your board it is good to get into the habit of putting the board into the upright position, starting it for about 10 seconds. This will take out the salt water out of the exhaust and the engine.",
